<h2>Description</h2>

<p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes! I ended up 
    getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a little different from plain 
    steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs, so I ended up throwing a few things together to make this 
    awesome crab leg recipe. This dish would be great with shrimp as well.
