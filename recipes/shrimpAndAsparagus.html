<h2>Description</h2>

<p>It’s pretty obvious that I love quick, tasty meals, but this one is superfast, even by my quickest 
    standards. Shrimp — that cooks up in a jiffy. And asparagus — well, that does too. And both of these 
    ingredients call for a quick cook because if you cook them too long, one will be rubbery and gross 
    and the other will be mushy and gross. So you are basically forced into make a fast meal with this 
    One Pan Shrimp and Asparagus dish. Boom. bang. done.
