<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The ground beef takes only minutes to brown but you still get that delicious Korean 
    flavor in this meal. The brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger combination 
    is the best.  It helps take the flavor to next level with the simple kitchen ingredients.
    The best part is that because we love Asian flavors so much I always have these ingredients on hand.
    All I have to do is buy a pound of ground beef each week. 
</p>
<p>
    You guys are going to love this meal just as much as we do! It is so delicious when 
    served over rice and I even like to add some veggies to my bowl to make it a well rounded meal.
    Sprinkle with some sesame seeds and freshly chopped green onions and you have about the easiest 
    meal that you will ever make! You will make this again and again!
